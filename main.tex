% Citations setup:
% This section is commented out in case you don't have the correct tools installed or if you want to handle citations differently.


% This may not be *exactly* the correct citation style, I think it's an older version of APA than we are "supposed" to use.
% However I also didn't even see anywhere in the rubric where it said to use APA, so I think the markers are checking if the citations look good enough rather than if you have exactly the right italics or quotes or whatnot.

As we agreed, I have prepared the enclosed report, “\WTT,” for
my \term work report and for the TEAM. This
report, the NUMBER of four work reports that the Co-operative Education Program
requires that I successfully complete as part of my BMath Co-op degree
requirements, has not received academic credit.
\vskip 10pt
ROLE IN COMPANY, BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES, PURPOSE OF REPORT must be added in a paragraph
\vskip 10pt 
The Faculty of Mathematics requests that you evaluate this report for command
of topic and technical content/analysis. Following your assessment, the report,
together with your evaluation, will be submitted to the Math Undergrad Office
for evaluation on campus by qualified work report markers. The combined
marks determine whether the report will receive credit and whether it will be
considered for an award.
Thank you for your assistance in preparing this report.

\sectionNoNumber{Executive Summary}

% Complete clear well organized summary of 1) the purpose of the report, 2) key points of analysis and highlights the conclusion

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% One of the most important components of the report is the Executive Summary. It should be written after the rest of the report has been written.

% The Executive Summary should be complete in itself and may be consulted by readers to determine whether they need to read the whole report. It appears on a separate page.

% Limit the Executive Summary to one page and briefly present

% the purpose of the report
% the key points of the analysis
% the highlights of the conclusions
% the highlights of the recommendations

\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% The Introduction establishes the purpose of the report and conveys the contents of the Analysis. You should provide the reader with the following information:

% necessary background information
% assumptions used
% major points covered in the report
% the situation or problem that is analyzed
% the purpose of the work report and the methodology used

% For full marks: 2-3 pages of analysis
% Very good: 1.5 - 2 pages

% A description of the steps in a process is not sufficient. The following list provides examples of acceptable analytical content:

% a discussion of cause and effect
% a discussion of advantages and disadvantages
% a comparison of two or more systems or products
% The following are examples of acceptable analyses:

% Why does a problem exist?
% How does the problem affect specific jobs in the workplace?
% How does the new system or product solve a problem?
% What aspects of the problem have been improved? How?
% What problems does the system or product not solve? Why not?
% How can the system or product be improved?

\newpage
\section{Conclusions}
% Conclusion highlights key points of report, succinct, relevant and insightful

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Conclusions section should be brief and should contain no new information. Conclusions should not make direct reference to sources, figures, or tables.

Each conclusion should follow logically from the facts and arguments presented in the Analysis section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Recommendations}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section is optional because recommendations are not appropriate for all reports. 

Recommendations are essentially speculative but should be brief and should follow logically from the conclusions. Include comments derived from experience that may improve future activities of the company.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\sectionNoNumber{References}
% If you are using biblatex to manage your citations, delete the above line and uncomment the two following lines:
% \clearpage
% \printbibliography

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Whenever possible, support statements with concrete, specific examples. If you refer to a published work, cite the reference in the text even if the reference is not a direct quotation. Include the author and year of publication.

I can never find where they state this but they want things in APA format. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\sectionNoNumber{Acknowledgments}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You may wish to acknowledge people who helped you with your work report. For example, you may thank someone you interviewed or someone whose files you borrowed. Do so in the last paragraph of your letter or memo, or include a separate acknowledgments page where you thank each person and explain briefly how he or she helped.
